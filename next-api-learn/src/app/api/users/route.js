// that's how we make api route in next js
// for ui routes we used to make folder which will be the route and in that page.js
// but for api route we create folder with route.js file
// it's mandatory to create route.js file
// here we can have get post put delete all the requests
// that's how we can create post request
// to get the body of the request we use request.json
// it's an await function so we have to make post function as async
